# Explanation of Folder Structure

This document explains the folder structure for the **Kubernetes-learning** repository, which contains various Kubernetes resources, tutorials, and configurations. This structure is designed to make it easy to manage Kubernetes YAML files and related content.

## Detailed Explanation of Each Directory

### 1. `README.md`
This is the main documentation file for the repository. It provides an overview of the project, the contents of the repository, and guides for getting started with Kubernetes. It should also include a brief description of the goal of the project and how to use the resources within the repository.

### 2. `deployments/`
This directory contains **Deployment** YAML files for managing **stateless applications**. A Deployment ensures that the specified number of pod replicas are running, and supports rolling updates and rollbacks.

- **Example**: `nginx-deployment.yaml` for deploying an Nginx server.

### 3. `statefulsets/`
This directory holds **StatefulSet** YAML files for managing **stateful applications** that require persistent storage and stable network identities. StatefulSets are useful for applications like databases that need to maintain state across restarts.

- **Example**: `mysql-statefulset.yaml` for deploying a MySQL database.

### 4. `daemonsets/`
This directory contains **DaemonSet** YAML files, which ensure that a pod runs on every node (or specific nodes) in the cluster. DaemonSets are useful for applications that need to run on all or some nodes, such as logging agents, monitoring tools, or networking components.

- **Example**: `fluentd-daemonset.yaml` for running Fluentd (a logging agent) on all nodes.

### 5. `replicasets/`
This directory contains **ReplicaSet** YAML files, which ensure that a specified number of pod replicas are running at all times. A ReplicaSet is often used indirectly by Deployments but can also be used on its own for simple scaling needs.

- **Example**: `nginx-replicaset.yaml` for ensuring that 3 replicas of Nginx are always running.

### 6. `services/`
This directory holds **Service** YAML files to expose your applications to the network. Kubernetes Services allow for communication between pods and external traffic.

- **Example**: `nginx-service.yaml` for exposing an Nginx deployment as a Service.

### 7. `configmaps/`
Contains **ConfigMap** YAML files for managing non-sensitive configuration data that applications can consume. ConfigMaps are often used to store environment variables or configuration files.

- **Example**: `app-configmap.yaml` for managing environment variables for an application.

### 8. `secrets/`
This directory holds **Secret** YAML files for storing sensitive information such as passwords, tokens, or API keys. Kubernetes Secrets provide a way to manage sensitive data securely.

- **Example**: `app-secrets.yaml` for storing database credentials.

### 9. `volumes/`
This directory contains YAML files related to **PersistentVolumes (PV)** and **PersistentVolumeClaims (PVC)**, which are used for providing persistent storage to applications that need to store data even if the pod is terminated or rescheduled.

- **Example**: `mysql-pv-pvc.yaml` for defining a persistent volume and claim for a MySQL database.

### 10. `helm-charts/`
Contains **Helm charts**, which are packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources that can be reused across different environments. Helm makes it easy to deploy applications to Kubernetes using these charts.

- **Example**: `myapp-chart/` for a custom Helm chart that packages all the necessary Kubernetes resources for an app.

### 11. `tutorials/`
This directory contains **Markdown tutorials** to guide users through various Kubernetes concepts, such as creating pods, configuring services, and managing deployments.

- **Example**: `pod-creation.md` for a tutorial on how to create and deploy a basic Kubernetes pod.

### 12. `scripts/`
Contains **scripts** that automate tasks like cluster setup, app deployments, or cleanup processes. These scripts make it easier to set up and manage your Kubernetes environment.

- **Example**: `setup-cluster.sh` for setting up a local Kubernetes cluster using tools like Minikube or Kind.

### 13. `docs/`
This directory contains **documentation** related to Kubernetes, such as guides on setup, troubleshooting common errors, or best practices.

- **Example**: `kubernetes-setup.md` for a guide on how to install and configure Kubernetes.

### 14. `.gitignore`
This file tells Git which files to ignore when committing code to the repository. It’s helpful to ignore unnecessary files such as logs, temporary files, or IDE configuration files.

### 15. `LICENSE`
This file specifies the **open-source license** under which the repository is distributed. Examples include the MIT License, Apache 2.0, or GPL-3.0.
